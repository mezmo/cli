### Chaos

The world of the terminal is a mess.
Inconsistencies are everywhere, slowing us down and making us second-guess ourselves.

Yet it’s undeniable that this chaos has been a source of power.
The terminal, like the UNIX-descended computing environment in general, places very few constraints on what you can build.
In that space, all manner of invention has bloomed.

It’s ironic that this document implores you to follow existing patterns, right alongside advice that contradicts decades of command-line tradition.
We’re just as guilty of breaking the rules as anyone.

The time might come when you, too, have to break the rules.
Do so with intention and clarity of purpose.
