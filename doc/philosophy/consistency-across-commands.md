### Consistency across commands (programs)

The terminal’s conventions are hardwired into our fingers.
We had to pay an upfront cost by learning about command line syntax, flags, environment variables and so on, but it pays off in long-term efficiency… as long as programs are consistent.

Where possible, a CLI should follow patterns that already exist.
That’s what makes CLIs intuitive and guessable; that’s what makes users efficient.

That being said, sometimes consistency conflicts with ease of use.
For example, many long-established UNIX commands don't output much information by default, which can cause confusion or worry for people less familiar with the command line.

When following convention would compromise a program’s usability, it might be time to break with it—but such a decision should be made with care.
