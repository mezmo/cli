## Guidelines

This is a collection of specific things you can do to make your command-line program better.

The [first section](./basics.md) contains the essential things you need to follow.
Get these wrong, and your program will be either hard to use or a bad CLI citizen.

The rest are nice-to-haves.
If you have the time and energy to add these things, your program will be a lot better than the average program.

The idea is that, if you don't want to think too hard about the design of your program, you don't have to: just follow these rules and your program will probably be good.
On the other hand, if you've thought about it and determined that a rule is wrong for your program, that's fine.
(There's no central authority that will reject your program for not following arbitrary rules.)

Also—these rules aren't written in stone.
If you disagree with a general rule for good reason, we hope you'll [propose a change](https://github.com/mezmo/cli/discussions).
